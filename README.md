## New functionality added for the wave-2

# Search Functionality

The search functionality allows users to filter the displayed items based on the input they provide in the search bar. Here's a summary of how the search feature works:

- Search Bar: A user can enter a search term in the input field. As soon as they click on the "Search" button, the system filters the items based on their name.
- Case Insensitivity: The search functionality is case-insensitive, meaning that both "Item" and "item" will yield the same result.
- Real-Time Filter: The displayed items are dynamically updated to match the search term.
- Clearing Search: After the search is performed, the input field is automatically cleared for the next search.

## See More Button

The "See More" button is used to load additional items on demand. Initially, a limited number of items are displayed, and users can load more by clicking the "See More" button.

- Default Items: By default, only a set number of items (e.g., 6) are displayed.
- Load More: Clicking the "See More" button loads additional items (e.g., 6 more each time).
- Conditional Display: The "See More" button only appears if there are more items available to load.
